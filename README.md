[Deployed Application](https://budget-tracker-211.herokuapp.com/)

## 📖 Description
This is a PWA deployment for an already finished application. Given the completed app, create offline saving using IndexedDB, integrate Service Worker to allow the app to be used offline, and install a webpack to allow an app to be downloaded to the users device.

## 🚚 Installation
** This requires MongoDB to be installed and set up first **
<br>
1. Clone the codebase from the [repo](https://github.com/mpityo/budget-tracker).
2. Query to the root file directory in any command prompt
3. Run the following command to install required packages:
```
npm install
```
4. Start the server:
```
npm run start
```

## 💡 Features
 - If the user is offline, all submitted transactions are saved and uploaded after going online
 - Ability to download progressive web app (PWA) to whatever device the user is using
 - If the user is offline, the website will still function and "submit" transactions so the user can stay updated no matter the circumstances
